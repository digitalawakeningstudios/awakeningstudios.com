Working off of Belle & Wissell’s excellent wireframes and art direction, I created the software and fleshed out the UX for this massive interactive wall (eight 98-inch large-scale touchscreens). Interesting challenges included a networked "attract mode", and rendering HTML and CSS based content in a C++ and OpenGL wrapper app to maintain 60+ fps performance and finesse multi-touch gesture handling.
