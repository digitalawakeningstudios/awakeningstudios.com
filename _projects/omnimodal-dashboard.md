As the co-founder and CTO of Omnimodal, an Orlando based mobility tech startup and social enterprise, I was responsible for the design and implementation of our main product, Mobilize. Mobilize allows city staff to see and manage the whole mobility picture in one place: public transit, parking, shared mobility and more. The platform combines a sophisticated and scalable data processing pipeline with a user-friendly responsive web app to provide real-time and historical analytics tools.
