Using advanced GPU processing techniques, I created this cross-platform experimental art app that allows the user to interact with a million shifting and swirling colored points by waving their hands in the air.

Beautiful Chaos was created using Cinder, the Leap-SDK Cinder block, and Cinder-Particles, with support from Leap Motion during the developer pre-release and beta periods of the Leap Motion Controller.
