Accomplished NYC-based artist Anne Spalter hit upon constraints in the off-the-shelf plugins she was using for her work, so I created custom After Effects and Photoshop plugins for her that expanded her creative possibilities. She has used the plugins as part of her workflow for installations, 4k video, sculpture and high resolution print based works. Photos courtesy Anne Spalter.
