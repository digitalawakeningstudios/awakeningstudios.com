To accompany an evening length performance of new classical music for organ, Wil Smith composed a series of electronic works — interstitials — and asked me to craft some visuals for them.

Using Processing and a minimal aesthetic, I created imagery that was projected onto the organ pipes at two concerts, in Miami and Brooklyn.

Subsequently, we have collaborated many times mixing live interactive visuals and both contemporary and classical music.
