I joined the Schema team to help implement new features for their interactive data visualization platform, [Gist](https://www.gistapp.com/).

First, we built out the embedding capabilities of the platform to support a CMS-like experience for [The China Dashboard](https://www.schemadesign.com/work/china-dashboard) project's data-driven pages.

Second, I implemented a standalone data visualization in d3 involving multiple interactive chart types and dynamic filtering.

Finally, I researched and developed a geo-data processing pipeline to support adding new regions of the world with administrative boundaries for choropleth maps.
